💙 CardioGuard AI
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning (Flask API + Web UI)

Created with ❤️ by Vijay Shahi

🚀 Overview

CardioGuard AI is a machine-learning based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health metrics.
This project uses:

Logistic Regression (ML model)

StandardScaler (feature scaling)

Flask backend API

Responsive Frontend (HTML + CSS + JS)

The system takes user inputs (age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.), sends them to a Flask API, and returns:
✔ Disease prediction (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)
✔ Confidence score

🧠 Features

🔹 Accurate heart disease predictions

🔹 Fully responsive frontend (Mobile, Tablet, Android, iPhone, Windows, Mac)

🔹 Fast Flask API backend

🔹 Input validation

🔹 Machine Learning model saved using pickle

🔹 Clean UI with a modern minimal hero section
